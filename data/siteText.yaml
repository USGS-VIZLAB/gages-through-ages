introText1: "### U.S. Geological Survey Active Stream Gages"

explanationText1: |
   The [U.S. Geological Survey Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program](https://www.usgs.gov/science/mission-areas/water/groundwater-and-streamflow-information?qt-programs_l2_landing_page=0#qt-programs_l2_landing_page)
   is funded by Congress to monitor drought and flood across the US through a network of stream gages.
   
   Why should you care about USGS streamgages? The USGS has been monitoring streamflow since 1889, and data from streamgages
   have since become critical to hydropower operations, recreation, streamflow prediction, flood forecasts, emergency 
   management, engineering designs, and many other purposes.

introText2: "What Can You See in a Long Term Record?"

explanationText2: |
   In 1888, a group of [eight young engineers](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0778/report.pdf) descended on the Rio Grande River at Embudo, NM to 
   establish the first U.S. Geological Survey stream gage and learn the art and science of hydrography. The team was charged with measuring
   flow, sediment transport, and other water characteristics for the Rio Grande. With the exception of a few years in the early 1900s,
   the site has been operated continuously since 1889.
   
   Long term gages such as for the Rio Grande at Embudo, NM, can be used in the short term flood prediction, navigation, recreation; and are essential 
   for evaluating changes across years and decades, due to human impacts or long term atmospheric or solar cycles.
   
   Above, see the long term record of flow at the site. Mouse over the timeline to highlight specific years. The complete data record for
   this National Water Information System site can be accessed [here](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nm/nwis/inventory/?site_no=08279500&agency_cd=USGS).
